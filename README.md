# Sales Prediction with XGBoost and Random Forest

## Overview

This repository presents a research endeavor focused on utilizing two powerful machine learning algorithms, XGBoost and Random Forest, to predict summer product sales on the Wish e-commerce platform. The study involves extensive analysis of a comprehensive dataset, complemented by the inclusion of supplementary category data. The goal is to meticulously assess and compare the predictive capabilities inherent to these models with the overarching objective of enhancing e-commerce sales forecasting methodologies.

## Objectives

1. **Multinomial Classification Problem:**
   - The study addresses a multinomial classification problem where the number of units sold is treated as a categorical value due to its limited variability.
   - We aim to employ machine learning algorithms to tackle this classification problem efficiently.

2. **Dataset:**
   - Leveraging a comprehensive dataset sourced from Kaggle, we extract essential product features crucial for predicting sales.
   - Exploration of additional data related to tag categories and their platform usage counts is conducted to enhance the predictive model.

## Methodology

1. **Algorithms:**
   - XGBoost and Random Forest, two robust machine learning algorithms, are applied for predictive modeling.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Essential product features are extracted from the dataset to serve as input for the predictive models.

3. **Supplementary Category Data:**
   - Additional data related to tag categories and platform usage counts is incorporated to augment the predictive capabilities of the models.

## Results and Contributions

- The study aims to contribute to the existing repertoire of e-commerce sales forecasting methodologies.
- Ultimately, the goal is to enhance inventory management practices and foster business expansion within the e-commerce domain.
